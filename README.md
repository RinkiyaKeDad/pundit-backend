# PunDit

A fullstack project which allows users to sign up and post their awesome puns as well as view puns which other users might have posted.


Backend has been deployed at: https://pundit-a.herokuapp.com/

Frontend is live at: https://pundit.netlify.app/



## Tech

Built using Node.js, Express and MongoDB on the backend. I've created a REST Api which interacts with MongoDB Atlas. JWT authentication has been used and the token is stored in the user's localstorage.

## Contribute


All contributions are more than welcome. The project was built using create-react-app. After forking and cloning it you can run `npm start` after running `npm install` to run it on your local machine. It is completely fine if you mess something up. Make a PR with your changes. If there are some conflicts in the PR I will let you know how to fix that in comments of the PR and after resolving those I'll merge your code.
